Welcome to Structured Semidefinite Solvers. This currently barren project will one day host the source code for a number (1 or 2 at least!) of LMI program solvers.

To start contributing, first make sure that you have an up-to-date installation of Python and then clone the repository. We recommend development in the Python virtual environment. To do this simply run:
```
python3 -m venv venv
```
in your project directory. Don't worry, these are already in the .gitignore This will initialize the Python virtual environment, but *not* activate it. To activate, simply run

Linux:
```shell
source venv/bin/activate
```

Windows:
```powershell
venv\Scripts\activate
```
